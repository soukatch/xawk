# XAWK (eXtended AWK)

XAWK is an extension to the AWK programming language, originally developed by Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan at Bell Labs in 1977. Since AWK (in my humble opinion) is already a well designed, useful, and powerful language, the goal is not to create an alternative, but rather add some features that I think would further the functionality, including:

* Explicit variable declaration.
* Scopes.
* Structs.
* First-class functions.
* An augmented standard library
* Code import.

The project is still in its germinal phases, but is growing at a solid rate. If you have any criticisms/suggestions please share them :)
